"1) The person who took my call (toll free number) for service booking needs training on how to handle calls within reasonable timeframe. 
2) Cost for service (minor service ) is comparatively very high considering scope of work (AED 1800+). There are many reasons for this, but is it worth for a customer to think and comeback again to Al Masood for services eventhough there are other premium service centers around Abu Dhabi who can do same quality of services and use original parts with lesser cost (atleast 25-35% lesser ).",Parag Laxmayyan,Nissan,NISSAN Service Mussafah,2023-01-06
"Is cleaning the interior and exterior of the car after maintenance work free of charge?! I suggest adding a symbolic amount for thorough cleaning and possibly polishing.. Better than your free service!

The car on the last visit was not cleaned.. Or it was cleaned quickly and unsatisfactorily!

However please note for improvement on the part prices and service costs it is very expensive, my car is out of warranty now for last 3 - 4 years but I am getting it serviced from Nissan only, now this time cost was very high, therefore I am now evaluating going to some other reputed servicing company who would do it fraction of cost with genuine spares there are some in musaffah. In this case I would urge Nissan give me rate preference and far better cost than now so that I can come back to Nissan for my next service.

"My feedback is negative due to the issues I faced. At the same day of picking up the car I got to know that its not maintained from the workshop and in the history its mentioned that there is things need to be changed ( battery, brakes,..). Knowing that I have the right to know the car history before paying down-payments and proceeding with the purchase order. After that, at the second day of picking the car I noticed that car windows are not working properly so I send videos to sales people and to workshop but no action until now taken. I also took my car to the workshop for 10 days and no action was taken. I used to go to my work with a taxi for 10 days and then nothing happened. This happened a month ago and until now there is no action. Also we agreed at the showroom to get a spare key and I had a signed paper on this, they then changed their worlds that no key will be provided. I used to talk to managers and lot of people to get the approvals in which I don't have to do all of that.

From the moment I arrived, Marla was welcoming, courteous, and professional. She patiently listened to my concerns and provided me with detailed information on the services I needed. She also kept me informed throughout the service process, which gave me peace of mind.

I was impressed by Marla's technical expertise and their ability to explain complex car issues in a way that I could understand. She went above and beyond to ensure that my car was fixed properly and in a timely manner.

Overall, I was extremely satisfied with the service provided by Marla and wanted to take a moment to thank her for her excellent work. She is a valuable asset to your team, and I look forward to bringing my car back to your workshop in the future.

1. I had an appointment at 11 am, i submitted car at 11:15, normally it took 2 or maximum 3 hours everytime i visited before,. But this time even after 4 hours i went myself and work was not done.

2. The car was not properly clean from inside.

3. I did service on Saturday, on sunday i stayed at home, didn't use car. On Mondays, i was not able to start car as battery was down, they said change battery so i changed.
It means, the service team didn't check battery health or may be it was not included in the package.

4. Still i m feeling a frictional driving sense as it was before service. Because after every service, the car drives very smoothly because of oil change and other things. But this is not true for me this time. I don't know why. ",12171Janidu Harindra,Nissan,NISSAN Service Mussafah,2023-02-25

"I want to point out some issue that is always happening which is i need to pay an extra amount upon almost each visit aside than 1.5 yearly subscription. This service as per your employees should be done no matter what. Thus, why i need to pay ahead of time for every 3 services - 10,000 KM if there will be an extra charge almost every time. Kindly be noted that it is not a broken part or something that popped out upon the service. It is a part of the major service that should be done before even checking the car upon submitting the keys to nissan to proceed with the service(I think it is engine cleaning).Moreover, upon proceeding with the payment the cashier was too slow busy with all of the paper work with each customer which almost took maybe more than 5 minutes just waiting for the employee to print out the paper organizing them finish his paperwork than to proceed with the payment. Also, it was not organized at all. For example, we were 4 standing in line, one of the employees told the 4th person( which is considered the last one) to go to cashier 2. What about the first 3 people that were waiting in line for more than 10 minutes and why the 4th person which didnt wait for 2 minutes to go ahead of the waiting people to proceed with her payment. 
On the other hand, Marla‚Äôs customer service was really good. She explained all details in a professional way. ",Marla Nunez,,,2023-02-27

"my car is new, i bought is on April 2019, it only went for 29000 km until now. I'm taking very good care of it, it's slightly used. Yet, a couple of days ago the AC suddenly stopped working, I refilled gas and the next day it stopped working again. I took it for service, and after check up I was told that there's a small hole in the heating unit in one of it's pipes, and that the whole unit will need replacement! and it will cost 10000 dhs! shouldn't this happen way later like years later, considering it's a new car with very light use and considering the high expectations working woth Al Masaood company??
I'm very very disappointed honestly, I regret dealing with Al Masaood
shouldn't the warranty for the AC in a new car like this be covered for 5 years?
I can't believe this level of unsatisfaction can be given by Al Masaood company. I thought I'll kerp getting service from them for a long time, but this unfriendly untrusted way of dealing with customers ended it for me. ",Nabeel A.,,,2023-04-25

"All of our Masood Cars at home are being serviced from day 1 at your center. However, this time was my worst, it took me couple of months to order a certain part to be replaced in my car. When the center received my part, I have clearly specified 1 day before that I will bring my car for service and changing the part. They clearly stated that it could be done in the same day due to that part being so small and doesnt need much work. At the day of the service, couple of things i didnt like, which is the labor price for changing the part (for example the part is 400 dhs, and the labor is 400dhs) this doesnt make sense to pay double the price for labor, and that labor price is only for the part and not for the service too. At the end, at 4:00 p.m, they claimed that the car needs more time (which was not as prior agreement) and that it should stay, I have asked for a replacement car atleast and they refused. I was really upset because I needed the car or atleast a replacement if it will take more time.
So, due to my need for the car at that day , the part which i waited for couple of months was not replaced, and the people center didnt even appreciate or consider giving me a reasonable solution as if i wasnt a loyal customer.

This is not the kind of loyalty i expected from al masood service center. Its a complete disappointment.

Regular maintenance is not what we are used to,Mohd Noureldin,,,2023-05-10
" I am completely disappointed, and this is not the first time this happens, I always find myself visiting the service Centre more than once fir the same issue to get fixed, last year I had to take the car 3 times to the service Centre for them to discover that one of the engine mounts are weak and need a replacement, my main complaint was a subtle vibration in the cabin and a noisy engine bay hood. First time the hood was tightened, second visit they dismissed the issue staying that was normal and for the third visit after they finally decided to do their jobs they discovered the issue. This year is no different. I‚Äôve took the car for 4 times including services where I told them there‚Äôs a very annoying rattle behind the dashboard. They kept dismissing it as they can‚Äôt to replicate the issue, I sent them so many videos detailing the issue and they never bothered to see what‚Äôs happening behind the dashboard. After so many visits they heard the noise and ‚Äúfixed it‚Äù under my extended warranty that took ages to finalize and longer to receive the parts from another galaxy and did the job. However, the noise is still persistent. I told them to have a look closely behind the dashboard since they are removing it to replace a bad actuator that I started to believe was fine. Since nothing really changed. I DO NOT understand what is the deal with the abysmal quality of work, they literally removed the dashboard and just look at the corner. WHY NOT LOOK AT THE ENTIRE THING? I have called them to express my disappointment. Now I have to take the car back to them. I no longer have the manufacture warranty and if the issue was not covered by the extended warranty then Renault service Centre will have to bear the costs of the repair if they have any shred of freaking consciousness. I will not pay a single dime for it, they had so many attempts when my warranty was active, a year to be exact of continuous visits and continuous let downs. I am a masters student and a medical personnel at an emergency department of a busy hospital, I can‚Äôt keep going back and forth for this non-sense. The car might be new but I swear to god the noise and rattle on the inside makes it sound like a 1970 car, and when I told them to get it fixed when I had the manufacture‚Äôs warranty I was told by one of the service technicians to not be a perfectionist. Now I am stuck with a car that I truly love but sounds like my dead grandfather‚Äôs car, a freaking squeak and rattle at every corner from the interior fixtures. I hope this message gets seen by the higher management. Cause this is pissing me OFF!!!!!!!!
",Vivian Rodricks,,,2023-05-10
"Your service and repair prices are really expensive and makes the client willing to do the works somewhere else.

Make sure the vehicle is handed back the way it is delivered.

His statement was this is due to sand between the wiper and windshield that has led to these scratches which are only visible after washing of vehicle. I was my car on a regular basis and while delivering the car these scratches were not there. Hence I find his explanation for scratches disappointing.

"As I have complained about an issue, yes I have went and drove the car with the technician. They took 2 days to find and fix the problem, however, I took my car out on Saturday and they said they found no fault. Unfortunately as soon as I got the car the same issue is there, I am not sure if they are ignoring, unprofessional or else. 

They technician recommended I take a picture when the problem occurs, not sure if he really meant it, as I guess you need to educate him with the traffic laws that we are not allowed to use the phone while driving (as this is the only time that the problem occurs).

I guess I will take the car to them again.",Mohammed Osman,,,2023-05-27

"My first setback with the Nissan service center is the expiry of the contract term. My contract expired on 30th April, and I visited the service center on 29th May. Due to eid and my busiess trip, i couldn't make it on April. 
The only option i had was to pay and use the service or renew the new contract. Money focused service was offered. 
Anand was very kind in asisiting and handling my querries. Im still waiting for the cost to change the bush. This was not done during the service time. 
Contract expiry terms are over killing and drastically impacting the customer experiance. There should be some flexibility for upto 1 month so customers won't loose their hard earned money. 
Honestly, my feedback is Nissan customer satisfaction is in free fall by forcing customer to pay for what he has already paid. Hope this goes to accountable person's ears to improve the experiance. Thanks",Anandhakrishnan,,,2023-05-29

They have no right to paralyze the board that was on the front, nor do they have the right to paralyze the sticker that was on the front end and the car inside is dirty. The situation in front of me is that the Filipino spoke to the customer and say that we are lying to the customer and saying that the key to the car is lost because they called Real, who is old and does not know English, and they answered the soft agency and the car. After that, I did not enter the Czech Republic. It is impossible to take from your agency again. I hope you teach those who work in the credibility We don't take it.

"Dear Al Masaood Service Team, 

First of all, thanks for you I had excellent experience in the Service Center in my first visit and thanks to Mr. Khalil Rahman he was helpful. 

I‚Äôm so sorry to raise this complaint here, but it concerns the Sales Department because last time I was unable to communicate the complaint to them in their survey questionnaire. Hope you look after my concern. 

I want to say that there is no transparency and clarity with customers from the sales department. I have already asked them to help me on the matter of (SD map card) for my car, that was not with the car upon receipt, and I told them about this issue several times, but there was no response. 

When I spoke to the sales manager Mr. Laith, he told me that he can‚Äôt find it because the car came without SD card, and he could not afford the cost of this memory card which is 3,600 AED 3 months after selling the car, and because the car is used so they didn‚Äôt know whether this part is available with car or not. Generally, I‚Äôm still waiting for solution to my concern. 

Thanks & Regards 
Khaled Al Jasmi

But now that the warranty is out, it does not work?!

"Hi 

My car was having couple of issues but everytime I come and give the car for service- new new problems arises. 

My service advisor Mr. KAMAL Is by far the best service advisor I has encountered. He has helped me resolve 90% of my issues. But last time when I came to recieve my car I have encountered new problem. The problem came after my car lower arm, and the Stablizer link for changed for both the front sides. 

Now the main issue that I am facing is that I am hearing clicking noise when I take U- TURN. The noise is soo loud when I take U-turn in my car and I feel that there is something touching the link rod of the front axle. Because this is something new that I have experienced. 

And I am not available always to come and drop of my car at the service center. Last time I dropped they had simply held my vehicle for 1 week without changing the lower arm and the link and now when I dropped the car on Tuesday 29th August, 2023 - they had fixed the AC blower noise ( replaced) and they told me they fixed the lower arm and the Stablizer link rod because of the suspension noise I had faced. But now new new problems are arising. Mainly when taking U- turn and the clicking noise while taking U- turn

"I want to bring to your attention the unsatisfactory customer service I received during my recent visit to your workshop at Nissan Airport rd. This is the second time I am sending feedback about the same issue; unfortunately, my prior complaint seems to have gone unaddressed.

My primary concern is the cashier's behavior. When I was supposed to pay my invoice, the cashier did not make eye contact, appeared angry, and displayed a complete lack of courtesy or respect. I informed him that I would not pay unless he made eye contact and acknowledged me.

When I am paying for a service, I should be treated with a basic level of respect and courtesy. If your employees are unable or unwilling to provide this, I think they should be replaced by automated machines which, at the very least, would not display poor behavior.

Customer service is a crucial part of any business, and I am disappointed that I had to experience this not just once, but twice. I hope you take this complaint seriously and take corrective action.

"There was a hassle with the appointment booking. I booked a month in advance and on the day of the service I was told that my booking was not in the system. Had to delay my car service to the next day.

"Salwa did not fail to give her well. Maintenance and the server took a long time for a full week. In this case, the customer deserves a replacement car or money to rent a car as the customer bought a full service and paid a large amount to fast the car. In addition, I received the car dirty inside and outside. The cleaning is bad. There is grease on the car outside and inside. I contacted Salwa in particular and sent videos proving this. Unfortunately, this type of service is suitable for the amount paid. Unfortunately, this type of service is good for the amount paid. Any malfunction outside the agency at half the price

"This was not the best experience I have had. I have always had excellent service and this was very disappointing. I was assured the service would be done on the day, i emphasized that I could not be without my car and I was assured it would be done. The pick up service was excellent, they collected my car before 10am. I received a call around 12:30 asking did I want additional services which I declined then to be told it would be ready on Monday (this was Saturday) was this OK? NO it wasn‚Äôt and I had to insist it be done in the day as promised or return the car to me. I had to be insistent and then felt it was a favor trying to get it done. Don‚Äôt book me if you can‚Äôt provide the service. I then got another call saying I would have to pay for the service, again I had to insist it was part of the service contract. Around 1pm I got a message my car was received although at that stage it was over 3 hours. Around 5ish I got a call to say the car was finished and Kyle be getting back on the pickup service but without being washed or cleaned was this OK, well again NO it is not OK. But my car was returned without being washed or cleaned. I was advised that I needed to renew a tyre and windscreen wiper, when I tried to ask when I was just told in the future, well what does that mean? 1 week, 1 month, 1 year?? Sales was very polite at all times but I just felt this was not a good service",Salwa Rboub,,,2023-09-11
"I am not very happy with the car provided to me. 
I opted for a new car because I travel to work almost 240 KM everyday. 
As a female driver, I opted new car for my safety since I travel 240 km everyday. I am unhappy that Masood provided me a car that has defects which threatens my life on road while driving. And I am surprised to see a defect on the new car? When the car was given for service a month prior they did not find out the defect? That‚Äôs sad. When I asked for a replacement car till the defective parts get resolved, I was told that there is no single car available. How can the company do such a thing to a female driver who is new to driving? Now that the car is been sorted in just two day, how can you guys assure me that you have done a quality service? I was told that it will take almost 10 days to get it serviced. But then I receive the car in just two days after the parts arrived? I want a reply with a reason on what actual service have you guys provided. Looking forward for a valid response from you guys. Thank you!",Charbel Semaan,,,2023-09-11

As a person she is nice but she is not qualified for this job, i decided that i will never use almasaood dealership to repair my car and will never buy any type of car that should be serviced in almasaood.

"Streamline internal processes. The car was brought through RSA, before that I have spoken to multiple employees from customer service and explained my problem. At night, Clifford called and asked if the service I wish to avail was for the 1st 1000km. Which gave me an indication that he didn't receive any information and how upset I was. He made me specify my concern about the car and wrote it down, as he would need to have his job done. 

He gave me a timeline of when the job will be completed and gave me timely update. 

While Clifford provided good service he didn't really gave me reassurance that nothing is wrong with the car. He just told me your concern of 1/2/3/4 is completed. He couldn't clearly explain why the car infotainment was down or assure me, nothing is wrong, all is good with the car and that he apologises for any inconveniences it has caused me. These things are important in service other than being nice. I didn't get a copy of the report which I thought would come in handy but I asked and he said he would send me.

Clifford is good. He can be better. ",Clifford P.,,,2023-09-28

"First of all, I am completely disappointed in my recent experience with your service team. I have been using Mercedes Benz for past 8 years and I never encountered such bad experience in the past. I am disappointed mainly due to following reasons; 
1). while handing over my Nissan Patrol for the first servicing (10K km) I wished to install the V08 Chromium Plated stickers both side of my car and I had mentioned this to the service adviser. I was advised by the service adviser at that time was to go to the spare parts counter and check the same by myself (which is unprofessional as to ask the customer to search for the internal departments and to meet customer's needs). I went to the spare parts counter and explain the same and the counter staff explained me that the actual cost of one sticker is around AED 360 and the discounted rate would be AED 190 per piece. Then I said, Ok to proceed and to fix 2 pieces on both sides. Then went back to the service adviser and informed the same. Then I was advised to come and collect my car after 5 PM, I reached in the evening around 5.20. She took me to the casher then and cashier said I have to pay AED 813.02 ! I was just shocked and answered how come this huge amount and replied that around AED 360/- for labour charges for fixing those 2 self adhesive stickers and remaining amount is for the 2 stickers..! I conveyed my concern to both service advisor and the cashier too, but they said even the job is light, there would be labour charges like this. Being a luxury and premium car, Mercedes Benz never charge me like this ever ! your staffs were in hurry to wind up and run away, not at all bothered to handle my problems,, not even the invoice provided to me for AED 813.02 I paid. The amount charged to me is too heavy and unfair, I could have purchase the sticker from spare part shop on a much cheaper and reasonable cost (the same original and could stick it myself, hardly it takes 2 minute job).
2) I had been following up with the service advisor to send me the invoice, even I sent her my VAT certificate, till this moment I did not receive the invoice yet.
3) As I was understood while purchasing my car that during the service contract either a drop off or taxi fare would be paid. Since I used taxi, I have requested to reimburse the same, but did not receive it.

So, the overall experience in my first service was too dissatisfactory. I urge the management to look into above my concerns and update me with an outcome.

"There are couple of things which I would like to list out here:

- when we had purchased the vehicle, we were advised that service up to 50000 kms were covered under the offer at the time of purchase. Now when I had visited the service center I was advised that the validity of 50000 km is one year and then I will lose the last service as it is falling out of one year. There should be clarity on this.

- second point- I had purchased the vehicle in October/ November 2022 and right now observed that the tyres provided initially were of the year 2021. On this 40k service I was strongly advised by the service advisor that these needs to be changed as it is of year 2021. I had to pay AED 3750 for replacing the tyres which is actually a lack of clarity from your side. When the car was purchased in October/ November 2022 then why were the tyres provided that of year 2021. These are all unknown expenses which were never advised earlier.

Would appreciate it there can be a full clarity when the new car is being delivered and not sure how this cash outflow can be compensated.",Asmaa Elsamman,,,2023-10-16

"The managers present, whether in the sales department or in the maintenance department, are inefficient, especially the director of the sales department for used cars. A peak in provocation and blaming others. They all bear responsibility for the maintenance personnel and the employees who work for them. But if the manager is indifferent to the customer's comfort and satisfaction, you don't mind his employees. I am more than dissatisfied and dissatisfied with the service. No one in Al Masaood tried to contact me to make my experience better. On the contrary, I am the one who pursues them and I get the worst answers and updates from the religious managers who represent Al Masaood Company in front of customers. All of them should be held accountable, especially the manager of the used cars section because he is the worst among all",Khalil Rahman,,,2023-10-17
I want to make a complaint because we bought new car not even crossed 10 K kilometers but the car stopped in the middle of the road on the way to Dubai abruptly this is not acceptable and also they said it‚Äôs fuel pump censor issue although we have petrol in the car the censor is giving wrong information and need to change the censor.

Sales team was supporting perfectly in an easy way,Janidu Harindra,,,2023-11-04
"There were a couple of concerns that I feel Renault as a Brand needs to improve for AL masaood Automobiles.

1. Service Center- I honestly feel Renault Mussafah service for customers is the smallest service center - in terms of space and service advisor compared to nissan and infinite. I honestly feel that al masaood -Renault should invest in a bigger space in terms of accommodating more customers in their service reception area and hire more service advisors. If you want to have more potential customers in the near future before selling the vehicle, please do invest in a proper after-sales service infracture. I feel as a renault customer that i dont feel valued compared to nissan / Infinite. I feel renault division compared to nissan / infinite is neglected in all aspects in terms of after-sales service. Me being a renault is planning on changing my vehicle brand to another one after witnessing all this, and no customer would be happy with the way the customer is being treated in terms of hospitality. 

2. Service advisor - I am only happy in terms of the service advisor you have hired. Mr Vivian & Mr. Kamal, but I am not happy where only you have 2 service advisor for the entire renault in Mussafah, which would increase the waiting period for the customers. I would recommend you to hire more service advisor like Mr. Vivian & Mr.Kamal.
My service Advisor for my 60 K service was Mr. Vivian, I have to say he was going on and beyond his way for providing and helping me with all the service and doubts as and when needed, during his leave , on and after working hours. Which is what a customer needs. A customer needs to have trust in the brands service - which Vivian never failed to provide. He provided an excellent service. Also the same goes with Mr. Kamal, He being the senior most-service advisor in Renault never fails to answer to doubts or queries. 
You need to hire more of Mr. Vivian and Mr. Kamal's character staff as it becomes difficult when one of the staff goes on for his annual leave . Atleast appointment a minimum of 3 to 4 service advisor for renault. 

Past and current service rating 

Mr Vivian - 10/10 , excellent service advisor in terms of customer service, humble, kind and down to earth person. 

Mr. Kamal - 10/10 , the most experienced person ever met in renault. Knows the in and out process of renault cars. Kind and tries his best to support all his customers and advises them the most recommended methods to maintain their car to reduce any future additional expenses in their car

Areas of improvement
1. Hire more staff - hire more staff to accommodate high volume of your customers and reduce the turn around time for addressing a customer and finishing the service on time.
2. Invest in your infrastructure - Have a bigger welcoming area for your customers
3. Have more transparency in service.
4. Get more inventory stocks - my car service was delayed this time because there were no parts available for my Renault Megane - delayed by 1 day for my 60 K service. 
5. Inform the customer in advance if there will be any additional costs.


One more most important thing, I would kindly want to you take into consideration is the Tinting and the polishing part which you guys provide to the customer.

I had also paid for your tinting and polishing and purchased in along with my car and I was surprised to know that you dont do the yearly polish for the cars which other companies provide to maintain the cars shine and protection from all the road debris. Usually companies provide 6 months or yearly complimentary polishing to maintain the cars shine and protection but here in Masood i need to pay extra for the polishing. Please look into this, as i am not able to do my car interior and exterior polish

All I got done now is the tinting replacement, which was covered under warranty by Ms. Suha, She has done an excellent job in supporting and delivering my car on time as promised. She had tried all possible ways to support and clear my inquires regarding the warranty of my car tinting and ceramic polishing. 

I hope my feedback adds value to your upcoming management decisions on the areas to improve.

"First service for 1K kilometer was done fast and accurate. Thanks to Mr Aries assistance.

But the passenger side seat that was damaged since i took the car from delivery wasn't fixed. The day car was delivered, it has already damage and same day i took it i informed Mr Tamer (from delivery team) that i'll send it back right away but he responded that he will fix it on the first 1K service. He didn't do anything, He LIED! car seat wasn't fixed. Bought the car brand new (Nissan Sunny SV+ 2024 model) expecting a perfect car but NO, it wasn't. Really disapointed! ",Aries M.,,,2023-11-28

There was no report marking my upcoming visit, so all the problems suddenly fell on me, almost as if the car's quality sharply declined after its 10,000 km service.
I am very displeased with this attitude

"The cost of a periodic examination visit is very high, especially the second visit
The car is still new. The mileage did not exceed 10 thousand cars
It is still new. There are no faults that require all procedures for this amount 
This is a change of oil and filter only if the first visit is for this amount, don't mind
In the next visits and in the event of non-visit, there is no guarantee, I mean the customer
Between two options, he will pay huge amounts of money, lose the warranty or buy a coupon
It is a small difference in the payment of the amount 
 We suggest taking into account the customer when visiting, you will win the customer better than him
He regrets visiting him. The service is good and the handling is good, but please consider
High maintenance prices

"Although I had notified the team when i brought the car for service about the screen notification I got which turned to be a issue with ABS, when I came to pick up the car after the service (after i was told the service was completed) I realized that the team has not fixed that particular issue. When I informed them they requested me to bring it back on the next day and that I would receive the car by noon (before Jumaa prayer). However the repair took almost a full day. So I literally left the car for two full days for a service that could have been made in the first day. ",Asmaa Elsamman,,,2023-12-01

"The customer care system at airport road is incredibly slow and outdated. I often have to wait for the allocated service advisor to finish with another client whilst other service advisors are sitting free. You then have to wait for ages at the impersonal cashier desk whilst the cashier ignores you and takes 10 minutes to print of an invoice and take a payment. It took half an hour for me to pay the invoice and collect my car - it should take no more than 3 minutes. Any service advisor should be able to serve each client, and should then take the payment directly, not send you to a separate cashier desk. The car servicing is excellent, but the inefficient customer service means I would consider moving to another garage.",Clifford P.,,,2023-12-15

The customer informed that she is not satisfied because she booked with recovery service at 9am , however no one called her at 9:30 so she called the reception of the service center and she explained to the lady receptionist that she had a bad experience with the recovery from the last service and they didnt call her yet so the receptionist reply to her "" what you want me to do know "" as she said so the customer was shocked about the way .
and the last thing she said at 10pm the recovery driver called her about the car and she said she was sleeping , and directly called her told her that im here waiting but he was not in the right location so she sent her driver to find him but she said he was so rude and he was shouting on the driver and he was telling him why you speak with me in English.
the customer said that we are a good company and like this you will loose customer and you dont have to deal with this kind of recovery companies because this will destroy your reputation .",,,,

"The rates are extremely high, it‚Äôs incomprehensible. I was shocked to hear that to fix a leak on the power steering it would cost 9000 dhs, or to replace a few hoses it would cost 2000 dhs. The pricing is ridiculous to the point where I‚Äôm looking to purchase a new infiniti Qx60 but after this service experience I‚Äôm now looking at other brands. ",,,,
"Well I received my car after so miss communication between the selling department and the handling department / anyway after receiving the car my first driving to the Nissan was not pleasant .. alot of vibration in the steering starting from 90 km / h speed even when the car in 0 movement , I started even to a fear to take my family with me. I called a friend of mine who had Nissan before to try it and he told me the same thing , I called Nissan Mr Bahaa and he told me that this is normal and we will fix it as soon as you bring it for the first service after 1000km , iam sorry but I never have this kind of issue with my other cars in the past ..
Mr Bahaa excuse that this car had a test drive but with a speed bellow than 80 km / h that's why people in Nissan did not notice your issues ! Iam struggle and even I don't know if this kind of issues can be found for a brand new car 
I need someone to communicate with me regarding my issues
